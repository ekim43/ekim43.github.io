    <li><img src="images/kessel.jpg" height="100px" width="100px"> <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8473548">Phil Kessel</a>: As the Leaf's most skilled offensive player, Phil would be a highly sought after target if the Leafs decide to blow up the team at the end of the season.</li>
    <li><img src="images/lupul.jpg" height="100px" width="100px"> <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8470207">Joffrey Lupul</a>: Although the oft injured player has not had a great year, Joffrey's skill level would warrant interest from a number of playoff teams.</li>
    <li><img src="images/phaneuf.jpg" height="100px" width="100px"> <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8470602">Dion Phaneuf</a>: While the captain of the Leafs has a contract that will scare most NHL teams away, a handful of teams will likely be willing to take on Dion's massive contract if the Leafs are willing to eat some of the contract.</li>

  <h5>New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs Talking Mike Santorelli Trade? </h5>
  <p>TSN Insider Darren Dreger, appearing on Tuesday night's episode of Insider Trading, revealed that the Rangers are seeking a centerman and could have eyes for Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mike Santorelli. "They're (Rangers) looking for a centerman and there might be a Leaf connection here. Keep in mind they tried to sign Mike Santorelli as an unrestricted free agent," said Dreger, per NicholsOnHockey.com. "All they had was $1 million, so the Leafs got him at $1.5 million. If things continue to go poorly for Toronto, maybe Santorelli becomes a deadline deal."</p>
